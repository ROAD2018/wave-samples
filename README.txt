The wave samples for the paper of "End-to-End Post-filter for Speech Separation with Deep Attention Fusion Features"

There are 100 samples.

1. "mixture" : the mixture samples
2. "target_clean" : the target samples ("s1" and "s2" means the two sources)
3. "uPIT", "uPIT+DEF+DL" and "uPIT+DEF+DL+E2EPF+attention" : different separation methods
"uPIT+DEF+DL+E2EPF+attention" is our proposed method in this paper.
